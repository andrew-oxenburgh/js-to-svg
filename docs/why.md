# Reason

I needed to create an icon for a project, and I'm much more comfortable with maths than some gui thing, and I love SVG, so I tried to create it using raw SVG, which was... not successful.

I created this templating mechanic that will allow you to create the SVG attributes via JS structures. This would allow me to space and size the components of the icon.

I then realised it might be useful to others, so here it is.
